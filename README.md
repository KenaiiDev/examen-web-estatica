# CuentaCuentos

CuentaCuentos is a simple MPA that allows you to read fully-original stories in a unique way, presenting six tales in two versions for each one: the first version is intended to be readen for all ages and also there's a horror-oriented version of the same story, aimed for adult public. Each of the stories is completely independent of the others, with its own AI-image related to it and only created for the story itself.

### Landing page

When you enter the website, it will show you a login form, in order to validate that you are 18 years old or older. If not, the horror category will be disabled as it is not targeted for children.

### Categories

Before you can choose the category you want to get in, it shows a disclaimer that warns the user about the usage of audio to improve the reading experience but the browser gets upset if the user does not interact witht the site before.
